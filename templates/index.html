        Welcome to the Network Info App (NI),

        In this app a network can be shown when loaded into the database. It contains a page with a list of all stops and lines in the database.<br>
        Each line page contains the number of stops in the line, it's start stop and end stop, transfers per stop and a table with the stopping pattern of that line.<br>
        Each stop page contains the stopnumber, location and transfers with neighbouring stops per service type (Local, Rapid etc.).<br>
        With the search bar you can search for stops/locations by name and location (for stops).<br>
        When logged on as an admin, the database can be edited.
    </p>
