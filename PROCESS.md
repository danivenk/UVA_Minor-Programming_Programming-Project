Setup minimal app,
I decided to use flask, flask-admin, flask-login, flask-migrate
These will be used because I'll be using this because the app needs to be written in python and has a database. Since I'd like to be able to easily edit the database as an Admin I'll be using flask-login and flask-admin (for login and admin) Because of this current models include a user (with username, password, email) and an anonymous user (for when someone is not logged on).
As a result of this I think it'l be easier to create the app and manage it.
From Web App studio I have some experience with those modules.

Basic setup of line and stop pages,
I've linked the stops table and the lines table with a many-to-many relationship, this is because A stop can have multiple lines and a line can have multiple stops.
With this a network can be created using these tables.

I've also intelinked the stop and line pages.
This way the you can reach all lines/stops on a line/stop page
This makes it easier to traverse the application

Added search function
With this you'll be able to search lines or stops based on their parameters.
The search function will split the queries into sub-queries and lookup every possible result and sort it by relevance.

Uniform style across main side and admin side.
This will make the app look more consistent across the whole app.
I think it also makes the app look more professional when the style is consistent across the whole app.

Not redefining all pages on the admin side,
This should in theory be less work, redefining all admin pages is a lot of work and instead using the already available ids and classes will make it easier to restyle the pages.

Added custom edit/delete glyphs (free to use ones, credit see image_refs.txt)

Updated the Design Document,
Finally decided on the final network for the database, the HankyÅ« Electric Railways network
This network conveniently covers all the functionalities I'd like to show. It has multiple stops across multiple lines, it has train types and a through service to a different railway company. The latter both of which I'm going to still add.

Added company to lines and continue stoptype implementation and link from admin side to main side and back when admin is logged on.
I decided to do this becaus this way when an admin is signed on he/she can easily go to the adminside. This has been done as an convenience to future admins, this way they don't have to know the url to the admin side.
