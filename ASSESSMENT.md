# Things I'm proud of
Search bar
Consistent style over both the admin side and the main side
Displaying the correct neighbours per stoptype
Displaying the stopping pattern
Getting the correct stopping order from the database and returning a list of stopobjects in the correct order from that.

The data itself, worked way to long to assemble it (about 2 days straight 11AM to past midnight). Probably because I wanted to use the correct location for each of the 103 stops

The logo although made pretty quickly, it looks quite nice IMO.

Making the Documentation look good, I mean I really wanna do things correct (as with the comments and docstrings in the files)
